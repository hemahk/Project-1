        <img src="Scotland_pics/1.jpeg" alt="Start">
        <p>My adventures started from O'Hare International Airport. I flew to Glasgow via Dublin.</p>
        <img src="Scotland_pics/2.jpeg" alt="GlasgowUni">
        <p>While at Glasgow, I studied at the University of Glasgow. Being one of the places that inspired the look of Hogwarts, the Potterhead shown in the picture was very happy.</p>
        <img src="Scotland_pics/3.jpeg" alt="Loch Lomond">
        <p>My first hike - I hiked up a hill that looked over Loch Lomond. It was exhausting but the view was so worth it.</p>
        <img src="Scotland_pics/4.jpeg" alt="Stirling Castle">
        <p>Stirling Castle - the first castle I visited!</p>
        <img src="Scotland_pics/5.jpeg" alt="Doune Castle">
        <p>Doune Castle - for all the GoT fans out there, this is the actual castle where they shot the location for Winterfell Castle in the show, Game of Thrones.</p>
        <img src="Scotland_pics/6.jpeg" alt="Glencoe Valley">
        <p>My second hike - Glencoe Valley located in the Highlands</p>
        <img src="Scotland_pics/7.jpeg" alt="Loch Ness">
        <p>Speedboat ride in Loch Ness!!! Didn't get to see Nessie but I did spot Urquhart Castle.</p>
        <img src="Scotland_pics/8.jpeg" alt="Wallace">
        <p>National Wallace Monument - built in honor of William Wallace (the hero from Braveheart)</p>
        <img src="Scotland_pics/9.jpeg" alt="Alnwich">
        <p>Alnwick Castle - for all the Potterheads out there, this is where they shot a lot of the scenes for the first and second movies of the Harry Potter series. This castle is located in England, just across the Scottish border.</p>

        <p>Some parts of Alnwich Castle the filmmakers used for filming part of the Harry Potter series.</p>
        <img src="Scotland_pics/10.jpeg" alt="Edinburgh">
        <p>Edinburgh Castle - the castle has so many buildings within the royal compound. This building is one of most recent ones built in honor of the Scots who fought during WWI and WWII.</p>
        <img src="Scotland_pics/11.jpeg" alt="Belfast">
        <p>Belfast, Northern Ireland - this is the symbol of Northern Ireland.</p>
        <img src="Scotland_pics/12.jpeg" alt="Tea">
        <p>My last day in Scotland was spent having some Afternoon Tea - the most proper thing to do in the UK.</p>
        <img src="Scotland_pics/13.jpeg" alt="End">
        <p>Before I knew it, the month had whizzed by and it was time to go home. Scotland was a blast and I would definitely love to come back some day!</p>
