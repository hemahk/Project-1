        <h1>Studying Abroad in the UK - Summer 2019</h1>
        <h2>Below are pictures of some of the places I went to.</h2>
        <img src="/Scotland-website-pics/1---Start.jpeg" width="288" height="512" alt="Start">
        <p>My adventures started from O'Hare International Airport. I flew to Glasgow via Dublin.</p>
        <img src="/Scotland-website-pics/2---GlasgowUni.jpeg" width="288" height="512" alt="GlasgowUni">
        <p>While at Glasgow, I studied at the University of Glasgow. Being one of the places that inspired the look of Hogwarts, the Potterhead shown in the picture was very happy.</p>
        <img src="/Scotland-website-pics/3---Loch-Lomond.jpeg" width="1024" height="239" alt="Loch Lomond">
        <p>My first hike - I hiked up a hill that looked over Loch Lomond. It was exhausting but the view was so worth it.</p>
        <img src="/Scotland-website-pics/4---Stirling-Castle.jpeg" width="288" height="512" alt="Stirling Castle">
        <p>Stirling Castle - the first castle I visited!</p>
        <img src="/Scotland-website-pics/5---Doune-Castle.jpeg" width="512" height="288" alt="Doune Castle">
        <p>Doune Castle - for all the GoT fans out there, this is the actual castle where they shot the location for Winterfell Castle in the show, Game of Thrones.</p>
        <img src="/Scotland-website-pics/6---Glencoe-Valley.jpeg" width="512" height="288" alt="Glencoe Valley">
        <p>My second hike - Glencoe Valley located in the Highlands</p>
        <img src="/Scotland-website-pics/7---Loch-Ness.jpeg" width="512" height="384" alt="Loch Ness">
        <p>Speedboat ride in Loch Ness!!! Didn't get to see the Nessie but I did spot Urquhart Castle.</p>
        <img src="/Scotland-website-pics/8---Wallace-Monument.jpeg" width="384" height="512" alt="Wallace">
        <p>National Wallace Monument - built in honor of William Wallace (the hero from Braveheart)</p>
        <img src="/Scotland-website-pics/9---Alnwich-Castle.jpeg" width="512" height="384" alt="Alnwich">
        <p>Alnwick Castle - for all the Potterheads out there, this is where they shot a lot of the scenes for the first and second movies of the Harry Potter series. This castle is located in England, just across the Scottish border.</p>
        <img src="/Scotland-website-pics/10---Edinburgh-Castle.jpeg" width="512" height="288" alt="Edinburgh">
        <p>Edinburgh Castle - the castle has so many buildings within the royal compound. This building is one of most recent ones built in honor of the Scots who fought during WWI and WWII.</p>
        <img src="/Scotland-website-pics/11---Belfast.jpeg" width="288" height="512" alt="Belfast">
        <p>Belfast, Northern Ireland - this is the symbol of Northern Ireland.</p>
        <img src="/Scotland-website-pics/12---Tea.jpeg" width="288" height="512" alt="Tea">
        <p>My last day in Scotland was spent having some Afternoon Tea - the most proper thing to do in the UK.</p>
        <img src="/Scotland-website-pics/13---End.jpeg" width="512" height="288" alt="End">
        <p>Before I knew it, the month had whizzed by and it was time to go home. Scotland was a blast and I would definitely love to come back some day!</p>
