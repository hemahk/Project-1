        <h1>Studying Abroad in the UK - Summer 2019</h1>
        <h2>Below are pictures of some of the places I went to.</h2>
        <img src="Scotland website pics/1 - Start.jpeg" alt="Start" width="288" height="512">
        <p>My adventures started from O'Hare International Airport. I flew to Glasgow via Dublin.</p>
        <img src="Scotland website pics/2 - GlasgowUni.jpeg" alt="GlasgowUni" width="288" height="512">
        <p>While at Glasgow, I studied at the University of Glasgow. Being one of the places that inspired the look of Hogwarts, the Potterhead shown in the picture was very happy.</p>
        <img src="Scotland website pics/3 - Loch Lomond.jpeg" alt="Loch Lomond" width="1024" height="239">
        <p>My first hike - I hiked up a hill that looked over Loch Lomond. It was exhausting but the view was so worth it.</p>
        <img src="Scotland website pics/4 - Stirling Castle.jpeg" alt="Stirling Castle" width="288" height="512">
        <p>Stirling Castle - the first castle I visited!</p>
        <img src="Scotland website pics/5 - Doune Castle.jpeg" alt="Doune Castle" width="512" height="288">
        <p>Doune Castle - for all the GoT fans out there, this is the actual castle where they shot the location for Winterfell Castle in the show, Game of Thrones.</p>
        <img src="Scotland website pics/6 - Glencoe Valley.jpeg" alt="Glencoe Valley" width="512" height="288">
        <p>My second hike - Glencoe Valley located in the Highlands</p>
        <img src="Scotland website pics/7 - Loch Ness.jpeg" alt="Loch Ness" width="512" height="384">
        <p>Speedboat ride in Loch Ness!!! Didn't get to see the Nessie but I did spot Urquhart Castle.</p>
        <img src="Scotland website pics/8 - Wallace Monument.jpeg" alt="Wallace" width="384" height="512">
        <p>National Wallace Monument - built in honor of William Wallace (the hero from Braveheart)</p>
        <img src="Scotland website pics/9 - Alnwich Castle.jpeg" alt="Alnwich" width="512" height="384">
        <p>Alnwick Castle - for all the Potterheads out there, this is where they shot a lot of the scenes for the first and second movies of the Harry Potter series. This castle is located in England, just across the Scottish border.</p>
        <img src="Scotland website pics/10 - Edinburgh Castle.jpeg" alt="Edinburgh" width="512" height="288">
        <p>Edinburgh Castle - the castle has so many buildings within the royal compound. This building is one of most recent ones built in honor of the Scots who fought during WWI and WWII.</p>
        <img src="Scotland website pics/11 - Belfast.jpeg" alt="Belfast" width="288" height="512">

        <p>Before I knew it, the month had whizzed by and it was time to go home. Scotland was a blast and I would definitely love to come back some day!</p>
